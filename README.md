Description and Usage: Software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. This application also passes all unit tests.

App instructions: npm install, in terminal enter "node server.js" to run application. To run test, right click test folder and select open in terminal. In the terminal enter "npm run test".

Installation: package.json
